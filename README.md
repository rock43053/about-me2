# about-me2
My name is Alejandro Maldonado. I am a person with a few different backgrounds. I currently work as an IT technician, while studying for IT tech I was also working on customers network system and have a Network Engineering background too. Before going into the IT field I was a Human Resource Manager in the Air Force but after getting out of the service no companies saw me as a manager and a small number of companies offered me entry level positions which is why I got into IT as a career. I also have a logistics background which was good while it lasted and I never looked back.

# For Fun
-I like making youtube videos on wide range of tech stuff that tech youtubers do touch on
-I like buying and reselling tech to try and make some $ or break even but get to review it
-I like indirectly learning new things
